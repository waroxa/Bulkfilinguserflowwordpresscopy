# Getting Started with NYLTA Bulk Filing

**Welcome!** This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to use the NYLTA bulk filing system for your clients.

**Who is this for?** CPAs, attorneys, and compliance professionals who need to file NYLTA reports for multiple clients.

**How long will this take?** About 15-20 minutes to set up your account and complete your first test filing.

## What You'll Need

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Your work email address
- Your firm's basic information (name, address, phone number)
- Your firm's EIN (tax ID number)
- 15-20 minutes of time

**Important:** We recommend doing a practice run first using fake client data, just to see how everything works. Once you're comfortable, you can start filing real client reports.

3. Click the **"Create Account"** button

### What Happens Next?

## Common Questions

### How do I know if my submission went through?

You'll see three confirmations:
1. A success screen after submitting
2. An email confirmation
3. The filing listed on your dashboard

### Can I edit a filing after submitting?

No. Once submitted, filings are final. If you made a mistake, contact NYLTA support immediately.

### How long does processing take?

Filings are processed immediately, but FinCEN review may take several days. You'll receive status updates via email.

### Can I add more people to my firm account?

Yes! Contact NYLTA support to add additional authorized filers from your firm.

### What if I'm not sure if my client is exempt?

The system provides exemption categories to choose from. If you're unsure, consult with your client or legal counsel. NYLTA does not provide legal advice.

### How do I upload multiple clients at once?

You can upload a CSV file with multiple clients instead of entering them one by one. Click "Upload CSV" when starting a new filing.
