## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### CSV Upload Issues

**Problem:** "Invalid file format"  
**Solution:** Make sure your file is saved as .csv, not .xlsx or .xls. In Excel: File → Save As → CSV (Comma delimited).

**Problem:** "Missing required fields"  
**Solution:** Check that columns A-H have data for every row. Scroll right to ensure all required fields for the filing type are complete.

**Problem:** "Invalid date format"  
**Solution:** Use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2024-01-15). In Excel, format cells as Text before entering dates to prevent auto-formatting.

**Problem:** "Invalid filing type"  
**Solution:** Column H must contain exactly "disclosure" or "exemption" (lowercase, no extra spaces).

### Validation Errors

**Problem:** "Exemption category required for exemption filing type"  
**Solution:** For clients with filingType = "exemption", Column I must have a valid exemption category.

**Problem:** "Company Applicant 1 required for disclosure filing"  
**Solution:** For clients with filingType = "disclosure", Columns K-R must all be filled out.

**Problem:** "Beneficial Owner 1 required for disclosure filing"  
**Solution:** For clients with filingType = "disclosure", Columns AA-AH must all be filled out.

**Problem:** "Invalid ownership percentage"  
**Solution:** Ownership % must be a number between 0-100 without the % symbol.

### Payment Issues

**Problem:** "Invalid routing number"  
**Solution:** Verify your 9-digit routing number is correct. Check with your bank.

**Problem:** "Account numbers don't match"  
**Solution:** Carefully re-enter your account number in both fields. They must match exactly.

**Problem:** "Payment authorization failed"  
**Solution:** Verify your bank account details. Contact your bank to ensure ACH debits are allowed.

### Login & Access Issues

**Problem:** "Firm profile incomplete"  
**Solution:** You must complete all firm profile fields before accessing the bulk filing wizard. Go to Settings → Firm Profile.

**Problem:** "Forgot password"  
**Solution:** Click "Forgot Password" on the login screen. Check your email for reset link.

**Problem:** "Account locked"  
**Solution:** After multiple failed login attempts, wait 30 minutes or contact support@nylta.com.
